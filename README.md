# Flask Website with SQLite Database
This project serves as a demonstration of building a dynamic web application using Python's Flask framework, powered by an SQLite database for efficient data storage. We also built a user-friendly interface by designing custom UI elements with HTML and leveraging the power of Jinja templates for dynamic content rendering.

## Features

#### Flask Framework: 
The project is built upon the Flask web framework, which provides a solid foundation for developing web applications in Python.

#### SQLite Database: 
The website utilizes an SQLite database for data storage. This lightweight, serverless database system is integrated directly into the application.

#### Custom UI with HTML and Jinja: 
We have designed the user interface of the website using HTML for structure and styles, and Jinja templates for dynamic content rendering.
